This is a test document for the RAG service.

It contains some sample text that will be processed and stored in the vector database.

The system should be able to:
- Extract text from this file
- Split it into chunks
- Generate embeddings
- Store the vectors in Qdrant
- Allow querying and retrieval

This demonstrates the basic functionality of the document ingestion pipeline.
